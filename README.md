#  HPDriverDownloader 0.1



Downloads HP Softpaqs and extracts them by OS / Model. Created as an alternative to the HP's Softpaq manager to organize softpaqs in a way that is easier to import in MDT/SCCM. 

Requires
	Powershell 5.0
	PS FTP Module
	Elevated Privleges (To extract Softpaqs)

Recommended
	DeDuplication - Each extracted softpaq is copied for each individual OS/Model configuration so deduplication is recommended to avoid disk waste.
